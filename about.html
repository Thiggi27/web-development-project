            <h2>About Tyler Higgins</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Tyler Higgins, I am currently a student at Kennesaw State University. Growing up I spent most of my time on the family computer. When I was 8, my uncle got me my very own case and parts to build my own PC. With his help I built my very first computer. This is where my interest for technology began.</p>

            <p>I am currently pursing my degree at KSU in Information Technology, and plan to begin my masters in Cybersecurity upon completion of my bachelors. During my time at KSU, I have engaged in a variety of projects that allowed me to combine my creativity with my technical skills. I am particularly interested in data center operations, and network engineering. The Tech industry surrounding healthcare also interests me. Upon Graduation I would like to work my way into an area of the IT field where I can make a difference and support a company with a meaningful cause.</p>

            <p>Outside of school I enjoy many hobbies. I enjoy spending time golfing and constantly driving myself to further my skills on the course. I enjoy film photography and developing my own film im my home darkroom. I also enjoy spending time with my best friend Luna, my 2 year old pug.</p>

            <p>I am eager to learn more and am currently looking for a internship or apprenticeship in the IT industry. Feel free to connect with me through the contact form on this site if youâ€™d like to learn more!</p>
